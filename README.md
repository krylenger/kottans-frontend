### My study log

### *12 October 2020*
## 0 Stage 
Today I've finished both git courses related to git. 
This helped me a lot to refresh my git knowledge because as usual I use a few basic git commands
and almost forgot how to implement them.
The 1st course (from Udacity) was quite simple. 
The 2nd one (from try.github.io) was a little bit tricky especially in the advance section.
Hopefully I've managed to complete them both, screenshots are attached. 
Although I didn't clarify some git advanced commands 100% but wrote them down to dive deeper when I'll encount them.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Today I've refreshed my Linux CLI and HTTP knowledge. 
As weel created my personal engineer-wiki in Notion. 
It's gonna help me to structure my knowledge and reveal the most important parts when needed. 

Also I've read 2 HTTP articles. I grasped the main concepts, however some details are really hard to understand at this point. 
My plan is to move futher to complete the main tasks but definetly come back after that to accomplish all optional tasks to get better understanding.

## Responsive Web Design

[screenshot_task_1](./task_responsive_web_design/screenshot_task_1.png)\
[screenshot_task_2](./task_responsive_web_design/screenshot_task_2.png)

This one was definitly a good refresher. 
In addition I higly improved my @media understanding.
It was a great practice to adjust the layout of different sections of website in lessons 4 & 5 in task 1. 
Definitly will implement "Off Canvas" responsive design pattern in my next project. 
I've tried it for the 1st time in this task and it was truly great! 

### *18 October 2020*

Today I've started my first study project - pop-up menu, developed using only html and css. 
I've already did layout part and toggle state. 
Writing it without JS was a little bit challenging but definitly improved my CSS skill. 

### *19 October 2020* 

Today I didn't have that much to code but anyway dedicated some time and almost finished my pop-up menu project.
It's approximately 90% done. 
Just some polishing work and moving forward. 
Today I've reviwed so much stuff! 
And learn new as well. 
I'm pretty excited about this exercise!

### *20 October 2020*

Pop-up task finished 98%
Trying to figure out for a long time how to implement TAB into sub-menu.

[codebase](https://github.com/krylenger/frontend-2021-homeworks/tree/pop-up/submissions/krylenger/html-css-popup)

I didn't write here for all these days however I've been coding/stydying every single day. 
For this period of time I've completed Pop-up task and finished Javascript section (read about this below) 
Working on this project I've learned so much new HTML/CSS stuff! 
Something from the list: 
- You should check you project in https://validator.w3.org/ (validator)
- BEM methodology (before I've been writing chaotic classes in HTML and selectors in CSS without any structure. Now I know the right way to follow!!)
- :before :after <- extremly useful!
- z-index <- one more important thing into my knowledge base 
- pop-up element implementation with :checked - this was really cool to learn!
- adding empty lines at the end of the file
- some unofficial rule of creating header navigation is to use such structure header>ul>li>a
- and many-many more!! 
I really appreciate all the feedback from mentors that helped me to learn new stuff and become better!


## JS Basics

After finishing this section I've realized that before my JS knowledge was pretty weak, mostly theoretical and just with a little practical background.
Tasks from codeacademy (epsecially Intermidiate Algorythms) helped me a lot to improve my undesrtanding and confidence. 
Tasks from Intermidiate Algorythms I even did 2 times to better understand and remember ways to solve different kind of problems. 

I've learned a lot about RegExp!! Before it was something mystical for me and I was a litlle bit afraid of it.
But now, after completing tasks related to RegExp and learning/practicing them for several hours I feel much-much more confident and can operate them without any problems.
It's so cool to learn and finally understand some complex topic! Yuhuuuu!


### *30 October 2020*

Today I've completed the initial course from Udacity about JavaScript and the DOM.
There was so much new and vital knowledge for me in this course!
I've learned the key principles of how Javascript is connected to HTML and CSS, the DOM model, its essential parts (like nodes and elements).
I've noted many new properties and methods which I'm going to use in my DOM project.
It was useful to learn what's the difference to where you add your <script> element: to the top or to the bottom of the HTML document,
And certainly very interested and important section about perfomance and how is JS engine and Browser works behind the scene. 


### *31 October 2020*

Today I've done the 2nd part of Intermidiate Algorhytms! This time it was much easier for me. 
After finishing the first part I've get a solid understanding and practice of how to work with arrays/strings/objects 
and which methods are better in the given task. 
This tasks were pretty cool I even get some kind of nostalgy feeling when I've been preparing to Math 
olympiad in school because some of the tasks were related to Math.
Also I've practiced recursion - and that's really great and makes your brain work!

Finally at the end of the day I've started my 2nd project - interacting with DOM elements, navigation without 
reloading the page.
I have a cool idea and will do my best to implement it! So excited) Yuuhuuu!


### *1 November 2020*

Today I've almost finished DOM project. 
I did all the layout, styling, created the database, added assets (images) to the project folder and resized them.
Also I've already implemented interaction with DOM elements without page reloading. (it's the main task)
Just to need to improve several aspects and I'm ready to submit my project!
 

 ### *2-5 November 2020*
 
 ## DOM

[demo](https://krylenger.github.io/kottans_task_js_dom/)\
[codebase](https://github.com/krylenger/kottans_task_js_dom)

This DOM project was extremly helpful, it let me practice my skills that I gained earlier (such as layout, responsive desing, etc) and as well as practice new knowledge related to DOM topic (event listeners, modifying DOM tree and its content, perfomance issues, etc.)

I would like appreciate the review from mentors once more because they've pointed out to weak parts of my code and helped me understand what's the best approach in particular situation. 

For example that big functions that do a lot of work much better to separate into smaller ones to increase the readability of my code and to make it easy to test in the future.

Also what was interesting - it's a good approauch to use `initApp` function and place there all event listeners and different 'load' functions. Then you can pass this function to document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initApp).


### *7 November 2020*

Completed all theoretical part of OOP course from Udacity.

### *8 November 2020*

## pre-OOP 'a Tiny JS World'
Completed pre-OOP project: 'Building a Tiny JS World'.
This task was pretty easy however I learned that I can use pre tag to display the text exactly as written in the HTML source code.


### *9 - 17 November 2020*

## Object Oriented JS

The same situation: even though I didn't commit in here for a week, I've tried to study every day.
For this period of time I've completed 2 sections: #9 (Object oriented JS)  and #10 (OOP exercise) and almost completed #12 (Memory pair game).
Please find my reflections on these tasks below.

  <summary>codewars_preview</summary>
  
  ![codewars - screenshot](/task_js_oop/screenshot_codewars.png)
  
</details>

The exercises from codewars were pretty simple at this stage and I'll definitly come back to them later to practice more my JS skills.
The OOP course from Udacity gave the general understanding of OOP im JS but I did some extra research to expand and structure my knowledge.

### Frogger game

[Demo](https://krylenger.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) |
[Code base](https://github.com/krylenger/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/tree/frogger)

At first I was pretty stuck but later on after researching some information I've found the approach to write this game with prototypes. 
Finally I got the taste for it and added some extra stuff to my game (stars, hearts and score/lives).


## OOP Exercise 

This task was extremly usefull in terms of understanding the key principles of OOP.
After that I watched the video from Optinal section regarding the advantage of Composition over Inheritance, I've decided to accept the challenge and use the composition pattern.
At first, my code wasn't that great but with the mentor's help I refractored it several times and recieved pretty nice and well structered code that follows the OOP principles (such as DRY, SOLID etc).

### *18 - 24 November 2020*

## Memory Pair Game

[Demo](https://krylenger.github.io/memory-pair-game/) |
[Code base](https://github.com/krylenger/memory-pair-game/tree/sound_version)

This was an extremly interesting and useful task! 
There are more than a dozen of new topics that I've learned creating this game and which I'm going to use in future:
-how to shuffle array using sort() and random number
-how to create nice flip animation
-that it's better to move literals which are appearing at least two time in the code into constants
-how to store information inside data attributes of element
-how to use closest selector
-practiced more in refractoring code
- and many many more!

And I was incredibly impressed when my work was published to kottans radio.. 
Another time want to thank for the feedbacks, it really helps me to grow! 


### *25 - 26 November 2020*

## Offline Web Applications

</details>

This task was quiet challenging for me. It was pretty simple to grasp the main concept and idea of SW but not that easy to accomplish practical tasks from Udacity course. 
Anyway I got the basics of SW and definitely will expand more on this topic after completing Friends App.



## Friends App

[Demo](https://krylenger.github.io/kottans-friends/) |
[Code base](https://github.com/krylenger/kottans-friends)

The last project has helped me to learn and understand the async JS, get the main idea and how to work with it. 
Also pretty useful was combining multiple filters and sorts to render only required data. 
This seems really very close to real projects! 


Wow! What a trip! 
The last project is done and it's time to celebrate!
Celebrate the finishing Stage 0 and New Year as well!!))
